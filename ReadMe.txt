Just type "make", to see the project component, "hangman game"

This game makes a call to system in order to clear the terminal screen
This has worked on flip for me but if it gives you hassle for any reason at all then run it in simple mode

simply run the program with the -s argument
"./hangman -s"  and it will run with an alternate clear screen function


to see exercise components run
"make -f exerciseMakeFile"
